Software to set the led display of the Wacom Intuos4 tablet
===========================================================

Features
========

1. The app uses libusb to communicate with the tablet.
2. Images are converted to an appropriate format under usage of the Magick
library.
3. The app contains an icon library. These icons can be used directly for
configuration the tablet display.

Pros:
-----
- Easy to use
- no kernel patch needed, i.e., works with the standard kernel

Cons:
-----
- must be root to execute the software
- the wacom driver must be reloaded after usage of the software
- works only with the Intuos4 M tablet (since I don't know the vendor and
product ids of the other Intuos 4 tablets).

Installation
============

To compile the sources, GNU C++ and the USB 1.0 and Magick++ libraries are
needed. Under Debian they are installed as follows:

apt-get install g++
apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
apt-get install libmagick++-dev

To compile the sources, change to the src directory and invoke make.

USAGE
=====

1. Perform a tablet led check:

	sudo intuos4-led-check

2. Output a list of all icons included in the library:

       sudo intuos4-led-config --list

3. Upload the library icon "WacomLogo" to the second button of the tablet:

       sudo intuos4-led-config --button 2 --icon WacomLogo

If you are left-handed, use the option --lefthanded to change the orientation
of the tablet.

4. Upload an image to the fifth button of the tablet:

       sudo intuos4-led-config --button 5 --image ../icons/icon-nikon.png

The image must have a resolution of 64x32 pixels.

5. Example of the combination of intuos4-led-config and xsetwacom:

       init-intuos4-tablet.sh
